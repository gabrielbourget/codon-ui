description: Private native foundation and explicit platform support limits.
---

@codon-ui/react-native owns canonical native source independently of the web React package. Its first foundation exports NativeThemeProvider, useNativeTheme and NativeThemeProviderProps, NativeTheme, NativeThemeOverrides and NativeThemeMode. Text/Button and other component counterparts remain subsequent reviewed work.

## Host And Package Ownership

The laboratory pins Expo SDK 57, React Native 0.86.3 and React 19.2.3 for iOS/Android. React and React Native are package peers. Expo, safe-area handling, app configuration and routing/fixtures belong to the showcase or consuming app. Web CSS, React DOM and React Aria are absent from the library runtime graph. Public native registry/CLI distribution and publication remain separate gates.

The root export has a react-native condition for canonical TypeScript source; declarations and compiled imports use dist. Build before consumer typechecks. Current proof is workspace-local; an immutable external-consumer archive is due in the Text/Button slice. Bare React Native, RN Web, other operating systems and earlier SDK combinations are unverified.

```sh
pnpm -F @codon-ui/react-native build
pnpm -F @codon-ui/react-native typecheck
pnpm -F @codon-ui/react-native typecheck:contracts
pnpm -F @codon-ui/react-native test --runInBand
```

## Theme Contract

```tsx
import { NativeThemeProvider, type NativeThemeOverrides } from "@codon-ui/react-native"

const overrides: NativeThemeOverrides = {
  colors: { foreground: "#123456" },
  actions: { primary: { background: "#2563eb" } },
  typography: { fontSizes: { b10: 18 } },
}

const Example = () => (
  <NativeThemeProvider mode="dark" overrides={overrides}>
    {/* Native app content */}
  </NativeThemeProvider>
)
```

Mode is explicit light/dark and defaults to light. The app may map OS or account preferences to it. Overrides merge defined named branch/entry values with that mode's defaults; explicitly undefined entries preserve defaults. They do not derive a new action palette from a changed root color. Nested providers resolve independent defaults and overrides. useNativeTheme outside a provider returns light defaults. Removing overrides restores defaults without mutating the caller.

The small theme owns colors, five action orders, spacing unit, radius, disabled opacity, native font-family overrides, 31 font sizes and six weights. Typography uses the inspected mobile-web ten-unit rem calibration (b10 is 14 logical units), system fonts and native default line metrics. Font assets/loading stay host-owned. Native ColorValue includes arbitrary strings; CSS variables and CSS color-mix expressions remain unsupported native inputs. Text/Button's color-validation boundary is still a decision at their kickoff.

## Evidence Limits

Public provider/type tests and platform JS bundle checks exercise the source and host graph. Mocked view assertions do not establish measured layout, screen-reader behavior, shadows, native press regions or rendered parity. Actual two-platform development/release builds and inspected output remain gated on native lab access; no support claim substitutes for those results.

The repository's docs/roadmaps/react-native-library-first-pass.md owns exact baseline hashes, per-component compatibility, current proof receipts, independent review and owner checkpoints. Use [Native Showcase](/component-library/native-showcase/) for the generic host and staged next steps.
